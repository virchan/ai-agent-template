    "Think → Act (ONE step) → Observe → Reflect → Repeat\n",

    "✅ **Pros:** Fully adaptive, handles uncertainty  \n",
    "❌ **Cons:** Purely sequential, slower for independent tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hybrid (This Tutorial!):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Think → Mini-Plan (1-5 steps) → Execute in PARALLEL → Reflect → Repeat\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ **Pros:** Adaptive AND efficient, best of both worlds  \n",
